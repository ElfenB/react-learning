# react-learning

This is my first project with React and helps me to learn the concepts and technologies behind it.
The idea is to start simple and refine the project further and further.

The project is based on an empty vite React template.

## Installation

To install the required packages:

```shell
npm install
```

## Run

To run the application:

```shell
npm run dev
```

## Learning resources

The learning path is based on:

- [The official tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html#overview)
- [Scrimba course from Bob Ziroll](https://youtu.be/bMknfKXIFA8?t=36735)
